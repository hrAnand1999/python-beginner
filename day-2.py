# Question 1 => Take your name and age as input and print them.
# name = input("Enter your name: ")
# age = input("Enter your age: ") # by deafult it takes input as string
# print("Name:", name)
# print("Age:", age)
# print(type(age))

# Question 2 => Convert '25' to int and add 5.
# age_str = input("Enter your age: ")  # e.g., user inputs '25' by default input type is string and gives value in string form
# print(type(age_str))
# age_int = float(age_str)
# print(type(age_int))
# new_age = age_int + 5
# print("New Age after adding 5:", new_age)

# str => string
# int => integer 2
# float => decimal number 1.23

# # Question 3 => Check types of various variables.
# var1 = "Hello"
# var2 = 10
# var3 = 3.14
# var4 = True
# print("Type of var1:", type(var1))
# print("Type of var2:", type(var2))
# print("Type of var3:", type(var3))
# print("Type of var4:", type(var4))

# # Question 4 => Take radius as input and print area of circle.
# import math
# radius = float(input("Enter the radius of the circle: ")) # by default input type is string
# area = math.pi * radius ** 2
# print("Area of the circle:", area)

# Question 5 => Swap two numbers without using a third variable.

a = 5
b = 3
print("Before swapping: a =", a, ", b =", b)
print("After swapping: a =", a, ", b =", b)

# 1. third variable
# 2. no extra variable
